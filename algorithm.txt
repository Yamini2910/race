GOAL: The goal of the program is to make us familiarise with Object Oriented Programming and memoery management in C++.

INPUT: The input is where we create 2 classes namely Horse and race and conduct a race between 2 or more horses in a track field.

OUTPUT: The output of the program is which horse wins the race.

STEPS:

1.Create header files for race and horse where we define the variables as private and public.
2.create cpp files for both race and horse and include their header files in it.
3.the cpp file contains the function which it is going to perform to get us the output.
4.In the race.cpp we initiate the horse position to the track lenght which it is going to cover, horse race and display which horse won the race.
5.In the horse.cpp we just initiate a random number for the horse to move forward.
6.In the main.cpp we include all the header files and ask for users input for no of horses and the track length.
7.If the input is less than 2 or negative we display a message saying its cannot be less than 2.
8.Finally we get the output of the horse which wins the race.
